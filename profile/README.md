## Welcome!

This project is kinda similar to [YoobieRe](https://github.com/YoobieRE)\
Like reversing Ubisoft Servers, Launcher, API's, DLL's, Protobuf's & Any connections.\
Expect it is using the C# Programming language.

## About "The Project"
The goal is making the website like SteamDB(link)\
Can track Manifest, Spaces, Applications and Store changes & More\
And an opened API to users who want to gather data & backup.\
To track this I need to make a website, and a good backend that updates.

## Team & Recrutier
Because alone this project is giving me headache, that's why I made this org.\
If you just edit some code to your preferences, or fixing English writing error.\
Feel free to fork and make a Pull Request.\
And if you want to join the Org, send your mail go uplaydb@protonmail.com

## Why? Why do you want this/do this?
Honestly no idea.
